## Milestone 1
I already had WSL2 (for Intensive Linux Programming course) and VS Code IDE installed on my device prior to starting this project. To install Docker, I clicked on the link to bring me to a Docker Desktop download page. After downloading Docker Desktop installer, I waited for the appropriate packages to be installed by it and then restarted my device. I then created a Docker account and logged in on my Docker Desktop application after verifying my email. I tried following this tutorial (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) but everything was already properly configured on my machine. My Docker Desktop Application already utilized a WSL2 based engine and I already had Docker support enabled in my WSL 2 distro by default. I also had the WSL extension installed in VS Code already.

This is an image showing the Docker Desktop app installed on my device for use.
