## Milestone 3
The Jupyter Notebook Milestone3.ipynb showcases the model training with hyperparameters optimized using Optuna. This trained model was saved to a text file (model.txt) and deployed in a HuggingFace streamlit space. The code for the space is shown in app.py and can be accessed via the link above. The trained model from Milestone 2 (oldmodel.txt) was also added and deployed on the web application.
## Milestone 2
The Jupyter Notebook Milestone2.ipynb showcases the model training along with SHAP values and SHAP interaction values for it.
## Milestone 1
I already had WSL2 (for Intensive Linux Programming course) and VS Code IDE installed on my device prior to starting this project. To install Docker, I clicked on the link to bring me to a Docker Desktop download page. After downloading Docker Desktop installer, I waited for the appropriate packages to be installed by it and then restarted my device. I then created a Docker account and logged in on my Docker Desktop application after verifying my email. I tried following this tutorial (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) but everything was already properly configured on my machine. My Docker Desktop Application already utilized a WSL2 based engine and I already had Docker support enabled in my WSL 2 distro by default. I also had the WSL extension installed in VS Code already.

This is an image showing the Docker Desktop app installed on my device for use.

This is an image showing WSL2 running properly with a simple Docker command.
